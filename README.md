## Chat History Format

Each phone number gets its own text file in the `chats/` directory:

```
[2025-05-31 15:30:45] User: Hello, I need help with my order
[2025-05-31 15:30:47] Assistant: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your order. Could you please provide me with your order number?
[2025-05-31 15:31:02] User: My order number is #12345
[2025-05-31 15:31:05] Assistant: Thank you! Let me look up order #12345 for you...
```

## Deployment on Oracle Cloud

### Using Gunicorn (Recommended)

1. **Install Gunicorn**
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   ```

2. **Run with Gunicorn**
   ```bash
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```

3. **Configure Reverse Proxy**
   - Set up Nginx or Apache to proxy requests to your Flask app
   - Ensure HTTPS is configured for webhook security
   - Configure DNS for hexawhite.quantumautomata.in subdomain

### Environment Variables for Production

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
PORT=5000
```

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS Required**: WhatsApp webhooks require HTTPS endpoints
2. **Token Security**: Keep your API tokens secure and never commit them to version control
3. **Webhook Verification**: Always verify incoming webhook requests
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook Verification Failed**
   - Check that your `VERIFY_TOKEN` matches in both Meta dashboard and `.env`
   - Ensure your webhook URL is accessible and returns the challenge

2. **Messages Not Sending**
   - Verify your `WHATSAPP_TOKEN` has the correct permissions
   - Check that your phone number is verified in Meta Business

3. **OpenAI Assistant Not Responding**
   - Verify your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid
   - Check that your `OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID` exists and is accessible

### Logs and Debugging

- Check console output for error messages
- Monitor the `/health` endpoint for service status
- Review chat files in the `chats/` directory
